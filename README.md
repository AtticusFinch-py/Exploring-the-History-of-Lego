# Lego Dataset Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of a fascinating dataset containing information about every single Lego block ever built. The dataset includes details about Lego colors, sets, parts, and themes, providing a comprehensive exploration of the Lego universe.

## Project Structure

The analysis is structured into several key steps, each focusing on a specific aspect of the Lego dataset:

1. **Reading Data**: The project starts by importing the necessary libraries and reading the Lego dataset, which is provided in CSV files.

2. **Exploring Colors**: The analysis begins by exploring the diversity of Lego colors, answering questions like the number of distinct color names available.

3. **Transparent Colors in Lego Sets**: The project delves into the distribution of transparent vs. non-transparent colors, utilizing the 'is_trans' column in the colors dataset.

4. **Explore Lego Sets**: The analysis shifts to Lego sets, investigating how the average number of parts in Lego sets has changed over the years.

5. **Lego Themes Over Years**: The project concludes by examining the number of themes shipped over the years, providing insights into the evolving landscape of Lego themes.
